# Reversi

This was a side project of mine to implement a Reversi game in Java back to my first year in university.

It is fully functional as a two human-player game, with hints for which chess piece(s) will be reversed, end game checking and restart game.

## Features

1. Two human-player game
2. Hints for chess piece(s) will be reversed
3. Nicely drawn chess piece
4. Broken UI in Mac (developed under Windows 2 years ago)

## Coding Style

1. Hard coded loops
2. Coding (like) a novice
3. Best-effort OOP
